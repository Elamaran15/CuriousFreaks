 Creational Patterns
- Singleton → One instance shared globally (e.g., Logger, Config)
- Factory Method → Create objects without exposing creation logic
- Abstract Factory → Factory of factories (UI toolkit themes)
- Builder → Step-by-step object construction (e.g., StringBuilder)
- Prototype → Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones

Structural Patterns
- Adapter → Convert one interface into another (e.g., legacy API wrapper)
- Decorator → Add functionality dynamically (e.g., I/O Streams)
- Proxy → Control access to an object (e.g., Lazy loading, Security proxy)
- Facade → Simplify complex subsystems with a single interface
- Composite → Tree-like structures (e.g., DOM, Filesystem)
- Flyweight → Share common objects to save memory (e.g., String Pool)


Behavioral Patterns
- Observer → Notify multiple objects when state changes (e.g., Event listeners)
- Strategy → Switch algorithms at runtime (e.g., Payment gateways)
- Command → Encapsulate requests (e.g., Undo/Redo)
- Chain of Responsibility → Pass request along a chain (e.g., Filters, Middleware)
- State → Change behavior when internal state changes (e.g., Order lifecycle)
- Template Method → Define algorithm skeleton, let subclasses override steps
